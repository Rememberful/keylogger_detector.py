# Keylogger Detection Tool

A simple Python-based tool to detect keyloggers and malicious software on your system. This tool scans for suspicious processes, checks for potential keylogger files, monitors network connections, and integrates with VirusTotal to verify the reputation of files.

## Features

* **Process Scanning:** Identifies suspicious processes that might indicate the presence of a keylogger.
* **File Behavior Check:** Looks for files that match known keylogger patterns (e.g., `keylog.txt`, `keystrokes.dat`).
* **Network Connection Monitoring:** Monitors active outbound network connections for unusual activity.
* **VirusTotal Integration:** Sends file hashes to VirusTotal to check for known malware.

## Requirements

Before running the tool, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install psutil requests
```
## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository or download the Python script:**

    ```
    keylogger_detector.py
    ```

2.  **Create a VirusTotal API Key:**

      * Sign up at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and get your free API key.
      * Replace the `YOUR_API_KEY` placeholder in the `keylogger_detector.py` script with your own VirusTotal API key.

3.  **Run the Script:**
    To start detecting potential keyloggers and suspicious activity, simply run:

    ```bash
    python keylogger_detector.py
    ```

## Check the Results

The script will print the findings in the console, including:

  * Suspicious processes
  * Files related to keyloggers
  * Network connections
  * VirusTotal scan results for suspicious files

## Features in Development

  * **Automatic logging:** Future versions will log results to a file for auditing.
  * **GUI Interface:** Consider adding a graphical interface for easier use by non-technical users.
